ljmdmc is a program that performs Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations with a Lennard Jones fluid.

COMPILING THE PROGRAM
The program has been designed to be compiled on both Windows and Linux 
systems.

*Windows*
The program can be opened in Visual Studio 2015 and later by opening the 
project file called ljmdmc.sln.  The program can then be compiled 
following normal Visual Studio procedures.

*Linux*
The program can be compiled using the gcc compiler via the Linux command 
line using the GNU make utility and the included makefile with the following
command.

user@computer]$ make

This will create an executable named ljmdmc in the same folder.  The previous
compile can be cleaned with the following command.

user@computer]$ make clean

The makefile can be edited to use the Intel icc compiler if desired.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
The program is run from the command line and requires two arguments--the name
of the input file and the name of the output file.  For example, for an input
file arbitrarily named simulation.input and an output file arbitrarily named
simulation.output, the program would be run with the following command

user@computer]$ ./ljmdmc simulation.input simulation.output

This command can also be placed in a submission script when submitting the 
program as a batch job on a computer cluster.
